# Technologies Used
### JavaScript and DOM Manipulation
* Our primary focus will be on JavaScript, utilizing its capabilities for DOM manipulation. This involves dynamically updating the content of our website to provide a seamless and interactive user experience. Through this project, we aim to strengthen our understanding of event handling, selecting and modifying DOM elements, and asynchronous operations.

### Bootstrap
* We will incorporate Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and aesthetically pleasing design for our bakery website. Bootstrap provides a robust framework for creating modern and visually appealing user interfaces, enabling us to streamline the development process and achieve a professional look and feel.
